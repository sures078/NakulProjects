# CSCI 2021 Projects 

A1
- reading data from files into dynamically allocated arrays
- builds a simple display routine used to display data read using the previous problem's code
- simple hash table application 

A2
- created a battery meter simulation using bit shifting to change the display as necessary 
- using a debugger, gdb, in order to practice debugging code 

A3
- writing the battery meter functions in assembly 
- analyzing a binary executable to provide it the right input to "diffuse a bomb"

A4
- optimizing a matrix vector multiplication function 
- measuring the performance of 4 search functions 

A5
- simulated a memory allocator using linked lists for used and free memory blocks
- manipulated string symbols in an ELF (executable and linkable file)
