A word document with example outputs from the terminal has been attached.
Could not fit in entire output in screenshot.
In the file we hand in, we will have text files handy for you to test.
Highly recommend maga.txt (Hehe)

Node.java was used for implementing linked lists.
KeyFinder.java helped us find the optimal key used in the 'addKeyWord' and 'getKeyWordKey' methods in Hash.java
Do not run KeyFinder.java, it's a loop that goes on forever until it finds the optimal key.
Run Hash.java, type text file name in args[0]
Similar to TextScan.java, in the terminal run: java Hash (insert text file)
Otherwise, exception will be thrown
'getTokens' method borrows format from TextScan.java too

We will first have a histogram representation, which lets you clearly visualize the spread
Then the tokens are displayed along with their keys.
There is a user interface that asks you type in any token in the text file.
Pay attention to capitals and punctuation.
It will give you the correct 'key' of the token.
To exit out, just press ENTER.
